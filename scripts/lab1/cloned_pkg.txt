	broken_script.py is a script that counts fibonacci numbers 
but it got a problem (thats why its called broken haha)
it should have "in" instead of "on" so it could iterate over a list



	hack_secret_data.py is a script that contains a function show_progress 
which basically draws a dot every second for a total of 6 dots. 
This script shows a prompt of trying to hack into some secret data storage 
with showing the progress (calling show_progress function) giving a prompt that we failed, giving another try and actually breaking in this time.
The script ends with a line that shows u the time that programm was running for 
(26 seconds in our case)
